\usage{
edit_matches(
  concepts,
  attributes = NULL,
  source = NULL,
  ontology = NULL,
  matchDir = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concepts}{\code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame(.)}}\cr the new concepts that shall
be manually matched.}

\item{attributes}{\code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame(.)}}\cr the attributes of new
concepts that help to match new and target concepts manually (must contain
at least the column 'class').}

\item{source}{\code{\link[=character]{character(1)}}\cr any character uniquely
identifying the source dataset of the new concepts.}

\item{ontology}{\code{\link[=list]{ontology(1)}}\cr either a path where the ontology is
stored, or an already loaded ontology.}

\item{matchDir}{\code{\link[=character]{character(1)}}\cr the directory where to store
source-specific matching tables.}

\item{verbose}{\code{\link[=logical]{logical(1)}}\cr whether or not to give detailed
information on the process of this function.}
}
\value{
A table that contains all new matches, or if none of the new concepts
weren't already in the ontology, a table of the already sucessful matches.
}
\description{
Allows the user to match concepts with an already existing ontology, without
actually writing into the ontology, but instead storing the resulting
matching table as csv. This function is used in the function
\code{\link{new_mapping}} and is not primarily intended for use on its own.
}
\details{
In order to match new concepts into an already existing ontology, it
may become necessary to carry out manual matches of the new concepts with
already harmonised concepts, for example, when the new concepts are
described with terms that are not yet in the ontology. This function puts
together a table, in which the user would edit matches by hand. Whith the
argument \code{verbose = TRUE}, detailed information about the edit process
are shown to the user. After defining matches, and even if not all
necessary matches are finished, the function stores a specific "matching
table" with the name \emph{match_SOURCE.csv} in the respective directory
(\code{matchDir}), from where work can be picked up and continued at
another time.

Fuzzy matching is carried out and matches with 0, 1 or 2 differing
charcters are presented in a respective column.
