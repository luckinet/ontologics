- fixing links with placeholders that dont throw error messages.

# 27.09.2022

- one of the vignette contains links that are currently only dummy links. I do get a NOTE when checking on rhub. These links are supposed to work in the future, as they are currently being set up.

# 08.07.2022

- much more development and thus no immediate re-submission. Now it's a new version, so we restart the submission process soon.

# 21.06.2022

- including fixes that the examples don't try to write into the package directory anymore. This also implements a new feature which makes this version 0.3.0.

# 15.06.2022

- add \value and \examples to every functions description
- remove get_tree from the exported functions (thus no documentation)
